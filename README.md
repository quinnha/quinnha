### i'm quinn!

i'm just a tech-ish dude doing tech-ish things like:
- learning about accessibility
- adding blogs to my [website](https://www.quinnha.xyz/)
- making an [ai of myself](https://www.quinnha.xyz/quinn-ai) because it looked fun

i used to intern at google, but now i'm looking for 2024 new grad jobs out of nyc!

on my free time, i like to be a regular dude and like to do regular things like:
- taking too long to read descriptions at art galleries 
- smashing birdies and climbing rocks (without injury!)
- taking a fat nap (20 minutes)

check out some of my code here!
