### i'm quinn!

i'm a intern at google and 3rd year software engineering student at mcmaster u, just a tech-ish dude doing tech-ish things like:
- learning about accessibility
- reworking my [website](https://www.quinnha.xyz/) for the 1000th time
- making an [ai of myself](https://www.quinnha.xyz/quinn-ai) because it looked fun

on my free time, i like to be a regular dude and like to do regular things like:
- taking too long to read descriptions at art galleries 
- smashing birdies and spiking volleyballs (without injury!)
- singing covers on my [ukulele](https://www.instagram.com/qh.music/)
